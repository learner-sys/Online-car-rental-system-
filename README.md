# Online-car-rental-system
The project aims to perform unit testing on diffrent functionalities of the system. An automobile rental is a service that allows people to rent a vehicle for a specific amount of time, improving customer retention and simplifying car and personnel management. The Online Car Rental System aims to manage available services and data, with admin access to all customer and vehicle data. Customers create a profile with a unique username and password to access the system, which allows them to select service types, search for cars, and pay fees. They can also view, print, or email receipts. The system allows customers to interact with staff, schedule appointments online, and view vehicle details. The system should be quick and high-quality, fostering a strong user-system link.
